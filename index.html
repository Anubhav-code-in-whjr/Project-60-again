            I like coding because I can create and make different websites, games and apps on it. I can learn many more different languages such as html, css and javascript . I also like coding because I get to know and use different platforms of coding and I like that it has so many tags that can be coded to to give it styles and html.

            My favorite coding language
        </h2>
        <div class="line">
        </div>
        <p>Some of my favorite coding language are:
        <br>
        <br>
        HTML
        <br>
        <br>
        The html contains the main element which align other elements or insert images and text or create hyperlinks or take slices of videos or link other website with our website etc. Html also allows some features such as center and italics to be used in it. The computer always picks data from the main file which is index.html and the other two are need to be linked the computer.
        <br>
        <br>
        CSS
        <br>
        <br>
        CSS is used to give styling to the html such as deciding which colors or how much pading or margning should be given to the text or images  and some feature when we only want to change the property like when mouse hover chang color we can do it in css instead of using javascript. The main name of the css file  is style.css which can be linked to the index.html like this:     
        link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css".(I didn't put brackets because then the computer is taking it as a line of code)
        <br>
        <br>
        Javascript
        <br>
        <br>
        Javascript is used  to give code such as repeat or give an if or make a variable or increase or sutract numbers etc. Some features of the CSS can be used in the javascript.The main name of the javascript file  is main.js which can be linked to the index.html like this: script src="main.js"   /script.(I didn't put brackets because then the computer is taking it as a line of code)
        <br>
        <br>
        The following languages are linked with eachother

            I got the inspiration of coding from my teacher Aishwarya. She helped me in coding from the very first class and has been guiding me ever since. Thanks to her I got know about html , css and javascript.
